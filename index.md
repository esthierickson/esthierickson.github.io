### Week 1 (May 18 - May 22) <br/>
During my first week of the DREU program I met with my mentor Dr. Helena M. Mentis virtually. We talked about the many projects that her lab was working on. Her research focuses mainly on the improvement of telehealth by gathering input from health profressionals about remote mentoring and interaction. She gave me an overview of these projects and let me choose one to work on that sounded the most interesting to me. She was very kind nad accomidating which made me feel more comfortable. I thought that the research that they were going to do with collecting surveys and interviews from health practitioners about the benefits, stuggles, and new opportunities of the use of telecommunication solutions in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

### Week 2 (May 25 - May 29) <br/>
During my second week, I met the rest of the lab that Dr. Mentis oversees now virtually. I have never done research like this before and it was encouraging to see that everyone else was so excited to collaborate even if we were all geographically far apart. Everyone that I met during our Webex meeting were graduate or Ph. D students, so that was a bit intimidating. Even though I did not have much prior knowledge of the projects that everyone was working on, I was happy just to listen and learn about how their meetings work. It gave me a good idea of how much work goes into research collaboration.
